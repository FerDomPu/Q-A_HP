# Table Question-Answering: Harry Potter
-- Work in progress

Table Question-Answering model about a table with data about Harry Potter.

This model is not a definitive model. This is a learning model to understand how Natural Language Processing NLP models work.

After taking the NLP course on the Codecademy platform, I began to prepare this model to understand different types of NLP models.

The model types used are:
- Name entity recognition (NER)
- Part-of-speech tagging (PoS)
- Word embeddings

For a correct functioning of the NER model, a fine-tuning is carried out with the names of the characters in the table so that it recognizes them as proper names. This is done to learn how to fine-tune the model.

Data was obtained from: "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gulsahdemiryurek/harry-potter-dataset?select=Characters.csv"
